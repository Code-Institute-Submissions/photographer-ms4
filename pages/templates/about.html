            <p>One of my passions is photography work in the studio. I produced countless advertising campaigns for
                Brazilian artists, restaurants and photographic models in my studio.<br>
                <p>I work directly w​ith l​ighting control, photography and production, always focusing on achieving a
                    result with unique personality and soul.</p>

            <p>I cannot forget to mention that I sign several menus of restaurants and bistros in São Paulo and in the
                Northeast of Brazil, photographing dishes and recipes that are true works of art.<br>
                Speaking of ​works of art, I have a collection of photographs for Fine Arts, which allows me to work
                directly with architects and decorators, ​for instance, at C​asa Conceito​ and ​Casa Cor da Bahia​ -
                Brazil, in 2019.</p>
